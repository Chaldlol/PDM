This Code Will Present a Program To Any New User That Will Open Up a Data Form With A Secure Login Access Authenticator Audit For The Sensitive Data Collection.

The Form is Designed To be Easy To Follow and Will Help Keep The Technician Organized With His Data Collection And Be Able To Audit and Make Changes Needed Before It Will Get Pushed To The Main DataBase.

The Data Form Will Have All Proper Points To Capture. 
The Location Selection Will Open Up An Map and Legend of All The Data Points.
After Location Selection is Complete, The Component Selection Will Unlock and Display Appropriate Components To That Specific Location.

Once Login, Location, and Component are all Selected, Then The Rest of The DataForm Will Be Unlocked To Capture The Data Needed.
When Finished With One(1) Component, You Will Then Submit It To The Audit List Box Section To Hold Until The End.

You Will Be Able To Audit All Your Work Before You Push the Data To the MainFile With Update, Delete Buttons While Selecting The Line In the List and Retyping In the New Values of Data Before Submitting Update.
