STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. THE FORM WILL OPEN BUT IT WILL FULLY SEND TO EXCEL DUE TO KEY AND ADDING EXTRA CODE WITHOUT BEING ORGANIZED.

***************************************************************************************

FROM THE TIME OF THIS UPLOAD, I AM TRYING TO WORK ON NAMING THE VARIABLES OF THE COMPONENTS BASED ON HOW MANY COMPONENTS ARE IN THE LOCATION SECTION
THIS IS NOT COMPLETE AT ALL AND IS WHY YOU ONLY SEE IT AT THE TOP

***************************************************************************************
***************************************************************************************
THIS WILL BE UTILIZED ON A WORK SERVER OUT OF A NETWORK DRIVE. ONLY THE SAME 3 PEOPLE ARE UTILIZING THIS FOR THE LOGIN BUT STILL WANT A PASSCODE SYSTEM.
ANY IDEAS TO CLEAN UP THE GUI OR OTHER IDEAS FEEL FREE

THANK YOU

This Code Will Present a Program To Any New User That Will Open Up a Data Form With A Secure Login Access Authenticator Audit For The Sensitive Data Collection.

The Form is Designed To be Easy To Follow and Will Help Keep The Technician Organized With His Data Collection And Be Able To Audit and Make Changes Needed Before It Will Get Pushed To The Main DataBase.

The Data Form Will Have All Proper Points To Capture. 
The Location Selection Will Open Up An Map and Legend of All The Data Points.
After Location Selection is Complete, The Component Selection Will Unlock and Display Appropriate Components To That Specific Location.

Once Login, Location, and Component are all Selected, Then The Rest of The DataForm Will Be Unlocked To Capture The Data Needed.
When Finished With One(1) Component, You Will Then Submit It To The Audit List Box Section To Hold Until The End.

You Will Be Able To Audit All Your Work Before You Push the Data To the MainFile With Update, Delete Buttons While Selecting The Line In the List and Retyping In the New Values of Data Before Submitting Update.

After You Sendit To the MainFile, The Rest of the Form Will Unlock Again Except For the Login Will Remain The Same.
